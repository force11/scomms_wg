The digital age is seeing an informal convergence within the scholarly
communication space: the Natural and Health Sciences, the Humanities, Arts and
Social Sciences, applied and professional fields are all discovering that they
have more in common when it comes to the future of research communication than
differences. What is needed now is a program that will help us realize the
potential of this merger: the development of a _Scholarly Commons_.

This repository contains various working files for the FORCE11 Scholarly
Commons Working Group. Most group collaboration is currently handled via
[email](https://www.force11.org/group/6723/google-forum), documents on the
group's [google drive](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B-3fjDTO3dDaSUNWOFpNWW92QXM&usp=sharing),
and teleconferencing. Please sign up for the [working group](https://www.force11.org/group/scholarly-commons-working-group)
before requesting team membership or submitting pull requests on Github.
